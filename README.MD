I created this to practice my real data to tensor skills. I used the dataset from https://github.com/deep-learning-with-pytorch/dlwpt-code/tree/master lung scans for the volumetric data - thank you for your fantastic work.

Practice 25 times and explain line/by line to create "muscle memory" of data -> tensor.
